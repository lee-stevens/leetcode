# Leetcode Solutions

## How to use

This repository contains solutions for every Leetcode problem I've solved, each problem has a dedicated file which then contains all of my solutions for that given problem

Each problem file has metadata in the top section, most notably, there is a tags: field where the data structure can be shown e.g., <<Linked Lists>>, <<Arrays>>, <<HashMap>> etc... allowing easy find-all

Problem files are also placed in a directory that attributes to their main data structure. If there are 3 solutions, and the HashMap one yields the best results, then it goes in the HashMap folder, not the others.
